# WINJECTION-NATIVEAP
This is a small project i've been working on that takes a windows 11 process and injects it with shell code, which can be customised via main.c, we use the Native API in hopes to become less detectable from antivirus' and windows defender.

[Crow](https://www.youtube.com/@crr0ww) -- The YouTuber that made the tutorial for this code. I thank him endlessly for making such entertaining and informative vidoes.

## Notice ‚ÄºÔ∏è
This code was made for Windows 11 (x64) build 10.0.22631.2428. It may not work as intended on other builds. In addition. **THIS PROGRAM IS MALWARE!**, It's not that powerful, but depending on what's in the shell code, it absolutely can be, be safe, and happy hacking! <3
